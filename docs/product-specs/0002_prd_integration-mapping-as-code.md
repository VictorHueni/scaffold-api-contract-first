## 1. Problem Statement

In any integration architecture — whether SOA/ESB, microservices, or event-driven — OpenAPI documents the edges: the consumer API exposed on the API gateway and the provider API(s) on the backend. But the middle layer — the integration platform that transforms, maps, transcodifies, and routes data between these APIs through a canonical data model — is the most complex, most fragile, and least documented part of the system.

Today, mapping documentation lives in Excel spreadsheets, Confluence pages, or buried inside platform-specific artifacts (message maps, XSLT stylesheets, DataWeave scripts, ESQL code, Camel routes) that only integration developers can read. When a field is renamed, a code table changes, or a new provider is added, the documentation drifts immediately. Nobody trusts it. New team members spend weeks reverse-engineering the mapping from implementation code.

**There is no industry standard for documenting data mappings between APIs.** No "OpenAPI for mappings" exists. This PRD explores building one — a platform-agnostic, machine-readable, version-controlled, lintable mapping specification that lives in Git alongside the OpenAPI specs it connects.

### Architecture Context

```
Consumer API  →  API Gateway  →  Integration Layer  →  Provider API(s)
(OpenAPI)                        ↕                      (OpenAPI)
                           Canonical Model
                           (JSON Schema)

Integration layer may be:
├── ESB (IBM ACE, MuleSoft, WSO2, Azure Logic Apps)
├── Integration framework (Apache Camel, Spring Integration)
├── API gateway with transformation (Kong, Tyk, APISIX)
├── Custom middleware (Node.js, Python, Java)
└── iPaaS (Workato, Boomi, Celigo)

What needs documentation (regardless of platform):
├── Field-level mapping (consumer ↔ canonical ↔ provider)
├── Transformation rules (split, concat, convert, conditional)
├── Transcodification (code table mapping between systems)
├── Routing logic (which provider based on request content)
└── Canonical data model (the shared model in between)
```

### Who experiences this problem

- **Integration developers** — write mapping code but have no formal spec to implement against
- **API consumers** — don't know how their fields map to provider fields, can't predict transformation behavior
- **QA engineers** — test mappings manually, no contract to assert against
- **New team members** — reverse-engineer mappings from platform-specific code or ask someone who knows
- **Architects** — can't see the full data flow across APIs without reading implementation code
- **Platform migration teams** — when switching integration platforms (e.g., ESB to microservices), there is no portable mapping spec to carry over

---

## 2. Goals

- **Define a platform-agnostic, machine-readable mapping specification** (YAML-based) that documents field-level mappings, transformations, transcodifications, and routing rules between consumer and provider APIs through a canonical model.
- **Make mapping documentation "doc as code"** — version-controlled in Git, reviewed in PRs, validated in CI, generated into human-readable output.
- **Link mapping specs to OpenAPI specs** using OpenAPI Overlays and `x-mapping` extensions, so the mapping documentation is discoverable from the API spec itself.
- **Enable CI validation** — Spectral custom rules that check mapping completeness (every consumer field mapped, every enum value transcodified, every `$ref` resolves).
- **Enable platform bridges** — parsers that read platform-specific artifacts (message maps, XSLT, DataWeave, Camel routes, etc.) and validate them against the mapping spec, ensuring docs match implementation regardless of which integration platform is used.

---

## 3. Non-Goals

- **Replacing any integration platform.** The mapping spec documents what the platform does — it does not replace the runtime engine. The integration platform remains the execution layer.
- **Building a visual mapping editor.** For v1, the mapping spec is authored in YAML in a code editor. A visual UI is a future initiative.
- **Runtime message validation.** The mapping spec is a design-time/CI-time artifact. Runtime validation of messages flowing through the integration layer is a separate concern.
- **Standardizing the spec externally.** For v1, this is an internal specification. Publishing it as an open standard (RFC, Linux Foundation, etc.) is a future possibility if it proves valuable.
- **Replacing platform-native transformation languages.** The mapping spec uses JSONata for documenting transformation expressions. This does not replace XSLT, DataWeave, ESQL, or any other platform-native language at runtime.

## 4. Research: Existing Standards and Tools

### 4.1 Formal Standards (closest matches)

| Standard | What it does | Relevance | Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FHIR StructureMap** (HL7) | Declarative field mapping with transformation rules, conditionals, nested rule invocation | Conceptually the closest model for field-level mapping specs | Coupled to healthcare terminology; not generalizable without adaptation |
| **FHIR ConceptMap** (HL7) | Code-to-code transcodification with relationships (equivalent, narrower, broader, not-related) and unmapped code handling | Best formal model for transcodification tables | Healthcare-specific vocabulary |
| **OpenAPI Arazzo** (v1.0.1) | API workflow sequencing with data flow between steps using runtime expressions (`$steps.x.outputs.y`) | Covers routing and orchestration between API calls | Does not handle field-level transformation rules |
| **OpenAPI Overlay** (v1.0.0) | Adds metadata to OpenAPI specs without modifying originals, using JSONPath targeting | The mechanism for linking `x-mapping` annotations to API specs as separate files | New standard, limited tooling |
| **W3C R2RML / RML** | Maps relational data to RDF using triples maps | Formal mapping language with W3C backing | Wrong mental model (DB→RDF, not API→API); RDF/Turtle syntax is a hard sell |
| **ISO/IEC 11179** | Metadata registry standard for data elements | Relevant for canonical model registry | Does not cover mapping rules |

### 4.2 Transformation Languages (self-documenting)

| Language | Readability | Platform | Use as |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JSONata** | Excellent — `FirstName & ' ' & Surname` | Platform-agnostic (Node.js, Java, Go, Python bindings) | Recommended expression language for mapping specs |
| **JOLT** (bazaarvoice) | Good — JSON spec defines JSON-to-JSON transforms | Java ecosystem | Declarative transformation specs |
| **jq** | Compact but cryptic for complex logic | CLI, any platform | Simple one-liner transforms |
| **XSLT 3.0** (W3C) | XML-heavy, poor readability for JSON use cases | Universal (XML-based platforms) | Legacy XML transformations |
| **DataWeave** (MuleSoft) | Excellent readability and power | MuleSoft only (proprietary) | Reference for DSL design inspiration |
| **ESQL** (IBM ACE) | Procedural, platform-specific | IBM ACE only | Bridge target (parse, don't author) |
| **SpEL** (Spring) | Good for Java teams | Spring ecosystem | Spring Integration expressions |

### 4.3 Enterprise Approaches

| Organization / Tool | Approach | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **FINOS Legend** (Goldman Sachs, open source) | Pure language for data models AND mappings with formal syntax and visual Studio IDE | The most advanced enterprise approach — treats mapping as a first-class, version-controlled artifact |
| **MuleSoft DataWeave** | Declarative transformation language with multi-format support | Gold standard of transformation DSL design, but proprietary |
| **AtlasMap** (formerly Red Hat / Syndesis) | Open-source visual data mapping tool for Java, XML, JSON; mapping definitions stored as JSON | Closest open-source visual mapper |
| **Apache Camel** | Route-based integration with data transformation DSL | Widely used in Java shops; routes are code, not specs |
| **Banking/Insurance (typical)** | Excel spreadsheets and Confluence pages | The reality in most large enterprises; constant drift |
| **TMForum** (Telecom) | Canonical data models (Open Digital Framework) with no standard mapping format | Canonical model standard without mapping standard |

- Apache Camel: https://camel.apache.org
- TMForum Open Digital Framework: https://www.tmforum.org/open-digital-framework/

### 4.4 Data Lineage Platforms (complementary)

| Platform | What it offers | Use as |
|---|---|---|
| **DataHub** (LinkedIn, open source) | Column-level lineage, metadata ingestion via Python SDK | Runtime store for mapping metadata; discoverability layer |
| **OpenMetadata** | Column-level lineage, no-code data dictionary, 84+ connectors | Alternative to DataHub |
| **OpenLineage** (Linux Foundation) | Open standard for lineage events, extensible via facets | Batch/streaming lineage; adaptable for API mediation |

**References:**
- DataHub: https://datahubproject.io
- OpenMetadata: https://open-metadata.org
- OpenLineage: https://openlineage.io

### 4.5 Semantic Web Approaches

| Technology | What it offers | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| **JSON-LD** `@context` | Maps local field names to shared vocabularies, establishing semantic equivalence | Defines "what means what" but not "how to transform" |
| **SHACL** | Validation constraints on data shapes (cardinality, types, patterns) | Good for canonical model validation; not for mapping rules |

---

## 5. Proposed Specification Design

### 5.1 Canonical Model (JSON Schema)

The shared data model between consumer and provider, defined as JSON Schema files:

```
specs/
  canonical/
    Order.yaml
    Customer.yaml
    OrderItem.yaml
    StatusCodes.yaml        # Transcodification reference table
```

Each schema can include `x-` annotations for business semantics:

```yaml
# specs/canonical/Customer.yaml
type: object
properties:
  firstName:
    type: string
    description: "Customer's given name"
    x-business-term: "Given Name"
    x-data-owner: "CRM Team"
  lastName:
    type: string
    description: "Customer's family name"
```

### 5.2 Mapping Specification (Custom YAML DSL)

One mapping file per integration flow, stored in `mappings/`:

```yaml
# mappings/create-order.mapping.yaml
apiVersion: mapping/v1
kind: IntegrationMapping
metadata:
  name: create-order
  description: "Maps consumer create-order request to provider(s) via canonical model"
  consumer:
    spec: specs/consumer-api.yaml
    operation: createOrder
  canonical:
    schema: specs/canonical/Order.yaml
  providers:
    - name: acme-orders
      spec: specs/provider-acme-api.yaml
      operation: createAcmeOrder
    - name: eu-orders
      spec: specs/provider-eu-api.yaml
      operation: createEuOrder

routing:
  description: "Route based on region header and order type"
  rules:
    - condition: "request.header['X-Region'] == 'EU'"
      provider: eu-orders
      description: "European orders routed to EU provider for GDPR compliance"
    - condition: "request.body.orderType == 'DIGITAL'"
      provider: digital-orders
      description: "Digital orders skip physical fulfillment"
    - default: acme-orders

mappings:
  # Simple 1:1 mapping
  - source: "Order.id"
    canonical: "Order.orderId"
    target: "order_ref"
    transform: null
    description: "Direct pass-through, field rename only"

  # Transformation: split
  - source: "Order.fullName"
    canonical: "Customer.firstName"
    target: "given_name"
    transform:
      expression: "$split(source, ' ')[0]"
      language: jsonata
    description: "Extract first name from full name"

  - source: "Order.fullName"
    canonical: "Customer.lastName"
    target: "family_name"
    transform:
      expression: "$join($split(source, ' ')[1..], ' ')"
      language: jsonata
    description: "Extract last name (everything after first space)"

  # Transformation: type conversion
  - source: "Order.total"
    canonical: "Order.totalAmount"
    target: "amount_cents"
    transform:
      expression: "source * 100"
      language: jsonata
    description: "Convert decimal amount to cents (integer)"

  # Transformation: conditional default
  - source: "Order.notes"
    canonical: "Order.comments"
    target: "internal_notes"
    transform:
      expression: "source ? source : 'No notes provided'"
      language: jsonata
    description: "Default to 'No notes provided' if field is empty"

  # Transformation: date format
  - source: "Order.createdAt"
    canonical: "Order.creationDate"
    target: "created_date"
    transform:
      expression: "$substringBefore(source, 'T')"
      language: jsonata
    description: "Convert ISO 8601 datetime to date-only (provider expects YYYY-MM-DD)"

transcodifications:
  - name: order-status
    description: "Order status code mapping across all three systems"
    source:
      path: "Order.status"
      codeSystem: "consumer-status"
    canonical:
      path: "Order.orderStatus"
      codeSystem: "canonical-status"
    target:
      path: "order_status_code"
      codeSystem: "provider-status"
    codes:
      - source: "A"
        canonical: "ACTIVE"
        target: "1"
        relationship: equivalent
      - source: "I"
        canonical: "INACTIVE"
        target: "0"
        relationship: equivalent
      - source: "S"
        canonical: "SUSPENDED"
        target: "-1"
        relationship: equivalent
      - source: "C"
        canonical: "CANCELLED"
        target: "-2"
        relationship: equivalent
    unmapped:
      strategy: use-default
      default:
        canonical: "UNKNOWN"
        target: "99"
      description: "Unmapped consumer codes default to UNKNOWN/99 and trigger an alert"

  - name: payment-method
    description: "Payment method transcodification"
    source:
      path: "Order.paymentMethod"
      codeSystem: "consumer-payment"
    canonical:
      path: "Order.paymentType"
      codeSystem: "canonical-payment"
    target:
      path: "pay_type"
      codeSystem: "provider-payment"
    codes:
      - source: "CC"
        canonical: "CREDIT_CARD"
        target: "credit"
        relationship: equivalent
      - source: "DD"
        canonical: "DIRECT_DEBIT"
        target: "debit"
        relationship: equivalent
      - source: "INV"
        canonical: "INVOICE"
        target: "invoice_30"
        relationship: narrower
        description: "Consumer 'INV' maps to provider's 30-day invoice specifically"
    unmapped:
      strategy: reject
      description: "Unknown payment methods are rejected — no default"
```

### 5.3 OpenAPI Overlays (linking specs to mappings)

Separate overlay files annotate OpenAPI specs without modifying them:

```yaml
# overlays/consumer-mapping-overlay.yaml
overlay: 1.0.0
info:
  title: Consumer API Mapping Annotations
  version: 1.0.0
actions:
  - target: "$.components.schemas.Order.properties.fullName"
    update:
      x-mapping-ref: "mappings/create-order.mapping.yaml#/mappings/1"
      x-mapping-note: "Split into firstName + lastName in canonical model"
  - target: "$.components.schemas.Order.properties.status"
    update:
      x-mapping-ref: "mappings/create-order.mapping.yaml#/transcodifications/0"
      x-mapping-note: "Transcodified to canonical ACTIVE/INACTIVE/SUSPENDED/CANCELLED"
  - target: "$.paths./orders.post"
    update:
      x-routing-ref: "mappings/create-order.mapping.yaml#/routing"
      x-routing-note: "Routed by X-Region header and orderType field"
```

### 5.4 Folder Structure

```
specs/
  consumer-api.yaml                    # Consumer OpenAPI spec
  provider-acme-api.yaml               # Provider OpenAPI spec

    Order.yaml                         # Canonical Order model (JSON Schema)
    Customer.yaml                      # Canonical Customer model
    StatusCodes.yaml                   # Transcodification reference

```

---

## 6. Validation and Tooling

### 6.1 Spectral Custom Rules for Mapping Specs

Spectral can lint any YAML/JSON, not just OpenAPI. Custom rules for mapping files:

- Every field in the consumer spec schema has a corresponding mapping entry
- Every enum value in a transcodified field has a row in the transcodification table
- Every `$ref` to a spec file resolves to an existing file
- Every `language` field uses a supported expression language (jsonata, jolt, jq)
- Every routing rule has a `description`
- No mapping has both `transform: null` and a `description` saying it transforms (consistency check)
- Unmapped strategy is defined for every transcodification

### 6.2 Documentation Generator

A custom script (Node.js or Python) reads the mapping YAML and generates:

- **Mapping table** (HTML/Markdown): source field → canonical field → target field, with transformation rule and description
- **Transcodification table**: source code → canonical code → target code, with relationship type
- **Routing diagram**: decision tree showing which provider is called under which conditions
- **Coverage report**: which consumer fields are mapped, which are unmapped, which have no transformation

### 6.3 Platform Bridge (pluggable)

A bridge parser validates that the actual integration platform implementation matches the mapping spec. The bridge is a pluggable architecture — one adapter per platform:

| Platform | Artifacts to parse | What to extract |
|---|---|---|
| **IBM ACE** | `.msgmap` (XML), `.esql` files | Field assignments, transformation logic |
| **MuleSoft** | DataWeave `.dwl` files, Mule XML configs | Field mappings, transformation expressions |
| **Apache Camel** | Route XML/YAML, Bean definitions | Route conditions, processor chains |
| **WSO2** | Synapse XML configs, data mapper configs | Mediation sequences, field mappings |
| **Spring Integration** | Java config, SpEL expressions | Transformer beans, router conditions |
| **Custom middleware** | Source code (Node.js/Python/Java) | Function-level field assignments |

Each bridge adapter:
1. Reads platform-specific artifacts from the Git repo
2. Extracts field-level mappings into a normalized format
3. Compares extracted mappings against the YAML mapping spec
4. Reports discrepancies: "mapping spec says `fullName` → `firstName + lastName`, but implementation maps `fullName` → `customerName`"

For v1, build one bridge adapter for the team's primary integration platform. Additional adapters are added as other platforms are encountered.

### 6.4 CI Pipeline Integration

```yaml
# In ci/pipeline.yaml
mapping-validation:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - run: spectral lint mappings/*.mapping.yaml --ruleset rules/.spectral-mappings.yaml
    - run: node scripts/validate-mapping-coverage.js  # Check all consumer fields are mapped
    - run: node scripts/validate-transcodification-completeness.js  # Check all enums covered
    - run: node scripts/bridge-validate.js  # Compare platform implementation vs mapping spec
```

## 8. User Experience

Five personas interact with the mapping spec. Each has a different primary interface.

### 8.1 Personas and Primary Interfaces

| Persona | Primary task | Primary interface | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Integration developer** | Author and maintain mapping specs | IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ) with YAML + JSON Schema autocompletion | Daily |
| **Architect** | Review mappings, validate completeness, approve changes | PR diff view + generated documentation | Per PR |
| **QA engineer** | Understand what to test, verify coverage | Generated mapping tables + coverage report | Per sprint |
| **Product owner / BA** | Understand data flow, validate field names and business rules | Generated visual documentation (web) | Ad hoc |
| **New team member** | Onboard and understand existing integrations | Generated documentation + interactive explorer | First weeks |

### 8.2 Authoring Experience (Integration Developer)

**IDE-first, YAML-native.** The mapping spec is authored as YAML files in a code editor.

**What makes it productive:**

1. **JSON Schema for the mapping DSL** (`mapping-spec-schema.json`) — enables:
   - Autocompletion of mapping YAML structure (`apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `mappings`, `transcodifications`, `routing`)
   - Inline validation (red squiggles for missing required fields, wrong types)
   - Hover documentation (what each field means)
   - Works in VS Code (YAML extension + schema association) and IntelliJ (built-in YAML schema support)

2. **Spec-aware autocompletion** (future) — a VS Code extension that:
   - Reads the consumer and provider OpenAPI specs referenced in `metadata`
   - Suggests field paths in `source` and `target` from the actual schemas
   - Warns if a referenced field path doesn't exist in the spec
   - Suggests enum values for transcodification tables from the spec's `enum` definitions

3. **JSONata expression preview** — a VS Code extension or CLI command that:
   - Parses JSONata expressions inline and shows validation errors
   - Allows testing an expression against a sample payload
   - Example: type `$split(source, ' ')[0]`, hover, see "Result: 'Jane'" for sample input "Jane Doe"

4. **Snippets** — VS Code snippets for common patterns:
   - `mapping-new` → scaffold a new mapping file with metadata + empty sections
   - `field-1to1` → simple 1:1 field mapping
   - `field-split` → split transformation with JSONata
   - `transcodification-new` → new transcodification table with codes template
   - `routing-cbr` → content-based routing rules

**File example (what the developer sees in the IDE):**

```yaml
# mappings/create-order.mapping.yaml
apiVersion: mapping/v1          # ← autocompleted from schema
kind: IntegrationMapping        # ← autocompleted from schema
metadata:
  name: create-order
  consumer:
    spec: specs/consumer-api.yaml    # ← validated: file exists
    operation: createOrder           # ← validated: operationId exists in spec
  canonical:
    schema: specs/canonical/Order.yaml
  providers:
    - name: acme-orders
      spec: specs/provider-acme-api.yaml
      operation: createAcmeOrder

mappings:
  - source: "Order.fullName"         # ← autocomplete from consumer spec schema
    canonical: "Customer.firstName"  # ← autocomplete from canonical schema
    target: "given_name"             # ← autocomplete from provider spec schema
    transform:
      expression: "$split(source, ' ')[0]"  # ← validated: valid JSONata
      language: jsonata
    description: "Extract first name from full name"
```

### 8.3 Review Experience (Architect)

**PR-native.** Mapping changes are reviewed in the same PR workflow as code changes.

**What the architect sees in a PR:**

1. **YAML diff** — the raw change to the mapping file. Because it's YAML (not Java code or XML message maps), the diff is readable:
   ```diff
   mappings:
   + - source: "Order.loyaltyTier"
   +   canonical: "Customer.loyaltyLevel"
   +   target: "customer_tier"
   +   transform: null
   +   description: "New loyalty tier field - direct pass-through"
   ```

2. **CI checks on the PR** (automated):
   - Spectral lint: "mapping file is structurally valid"
   - Coverage check: "all consumer fields have a mapping entry"
   - Transcodification check: "all enum values have a row"
   - Spec reference check: "all file paths and field paths resolve"

3. **Generated documentation comment** (CI posts as a PR comment):

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Consumer fields:  6/6 mapped  (100%) ✓
Canonical fields: 8/8 defined (100%) ✓
Provider fields:  7/7 mapped  (100%) ✓
Transcodifications: 2 tables, 9 codes, 0 unmapped ✓
Routing rules: 3 (2 conditions + 1 default) ✓

Missing:
  (none — all fields covered)
```

- Red/amber/green indicators
- Lists unmapped fields explicitly
- Shows transcodification gaps (enum values without a row)

### 8.5 Interactive Explorer (Future — v2)

A web application where users can:

1. **Click a consumer field** → see its full journey: consumer → canonical → provider(s), with transformation at each step
2. **Click a provider field** → trace it back to the consumer field(s) it comes from (reverse lineage)
3. **Search** across all mapping specs: "where does `customerId` appear?"
4. **Compare versions** — diff two versions of a mapping spec visually (before/after a PR)
5. **Simulate** — paste a sample consumer JSON payload, see the canonical model and provider payload that would result (by executing the JSONata expressions client-side)

This is the equivalent of what AtlasMap provides visually but driven by the YAML mapping spec as the source of truth.

### 8.6 Interaction Summary by Phase

| Phase | Who | Interface | What they do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Author** | Integration dev | IDE + YAML + JSON Schema | Write mapping spec with autocompletion |
| **Validate** | CI | Spectral + custom scripts | Lint, check coverage, verify references |
| **Review** | Architect | PR diff + CI comment | Review YAML diff + generated tables |
| **Understand** | PO / BA / new member | Generated web docs | Browse mapping tables, routing trees, flow diagrams |
| **Explore** | Anyone | Interactive explorer (v2) | Click-through field lineage, simulate payloads |
| **Verify** | Integration dev | Bridge adapter | Compare implementation vs spec |

## 9. Design Considerations (Architecture)

---

## 9. Technical Considerations

- **JSONata** expressions can be validated at CI time using the `jsonata` npm package (parse without executing). Bindings exist for Java (`dashjoin/jsonata-java`), Go, Python, and .NET.
- **OpenAPI Overlay** is a newly standardized spec (v1.0.0). Tooling support is limited but growing. Redocly CLI supports overlays.
- **Spectral** can lint any YAML/JSON file, not just OpenAPI — custom rulesets for mapping files use the same infrastructure already in place for API linting.
- **Bridge adapters** depend on platform-specific file formats. Most integration platforms store configuration as XML or YAML in Git-compatible structures, making parsing feasible.
- **The mapping YAML DSL should be formalized as a JSON Schema** (`mapping-spec-schema.json`) to enable IDE autocompletion and validation of mapping files themselves.

---

## 10. Success Metrics

### Leading Indicators

- **Mapping spec adoption:** At least 1 integration flow documented using the mapping YAML format within 30 days of tooling availability.
- **CI validation active:** Mapping completeness checks run on every PR that touches `mappings/` or `specs/`.
- **New team member onboarding:** A new integration developer can understand an existing mapping by reading the YAML spec + generated docs, without asking someone or reading platform-specific code.

### Lagging Indicators

- **Mapping drift reduction:** Fewer incidents where the platform implementation doesn't match documented behavior (measured over 1 quarter).
- **Review quality:** Integration PRs that include mapping spec changes get more meaningful review feedback from architects.
- **Transcodification bugs:** Fewer production bugs caused by missing or incorrect code table entries.
- **Platform migration readiness:** When evaluating a platform migration, the mapping spec provides a complete, portable inventory of all field mappings, transformations, and transcodifications — independent of the source or target platform.

---

## 11. Open Questions

1. **Should the mapping YAML DSL be formalized as a JSON Schema?** This would enable validation of mapping files themselves (schema for the schema). Strongly recommended.
2. **Which integration flow should be the first pilot?** Pick a low-complexity, well-understood mapping to validate the approach.
3. **Should the canonical model be defined independently or derived from existing platform schemas?** Starting from existing models may be faster but risks inheriting tech debt.
4. **FINOS Legend evaluation:** Is Legend's Pure language a viable alternative to the custom YAML DSL? It provides more formal semantics but requires Java infrastructure.
5. **DataHub integration:** Should mapping metadata be published to a data lineage platform for cross-team discoverability?
6. **Which bridge adapter to build first?** Depends on the team's primary integration platform. The adapter validates implementation against the mapping spec.
7. **Should transcodification tables support external references?** E.g., referencing a shared code table maintained by a master data management (MDM) system instead of inlining all values.
